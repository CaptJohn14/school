/*
 * File:   TemplateEventChecker.c
 * Author: Gabriel Hugh Elkaim
 *
 * Template file to set up typical EventCheckers for the  Events and Services
 * Framework (ES_Framework) on the Uno32 for the CMPE-118/L class. Note that
 * this file will need to be modified to fit your exact needs, and most of the
 * names will have to be changed to match your code.
 *
 * This EventCheckers file will work with both FSM's and HSM's.
 *
 * Remember that EventCheckers should only return TRUE when an event has occured,
 * and that the event is a TRANSITION between two detectable differences. They
 * should also be atomic and run as fast as possible for good results.
 *
 * This file includes a test harness that will run the event detectors listed in the
 * ES_Configure file in the project, and will conditionally compile main if the macro
 * EVENTCHECKER_TEST is defined (either in the project or in the file). This will allow
 * you to check you event detectors in their own project, and then leave them untouched
 * for your project unless you need to alter their post functions.

/**
 * @Function TemplateCheckBattery(void)
 * @param none
 * @return TRUE or FALSE
 * @brief This function is a prototype event checker that checks the battery voltage
 *        against a fixed threshold (#defined in the .c file). Note that you need to
 *        keep track of previous history, and that the actual battery voltage is checked
 *        only once at the beginning of the function. The function will post an event
 *        of either BATTERY_CONNECTED or BATTERY_DISCONNECTED if the power switch is turned
 *        on or off with the USB cord plugged into the Uno32. Returns TRUE if there was an 
 *        event, FALSE otherwise.
 * @note Use this code as a template for your other event checkers, and modify as necessary.
