HW4:
I didn't expect this to be that difficult. I was wrong. I thought I would just
be copying and pasting my hw1 and manipulate my solve function a little so it
doesn't involve recursion. In the end, yes, that was really all it was but
working with stacks is a headache. Recursion makes things a lot simpler even
though recursion itself is a headache. I've learned to appreciate recursion
now.

For this hw, I tried to do some recursion to stack practices on the side to get
a feel for it starting with factorial to printing stuff backwards. This helped
me get a feel for how to structure a how to for converting recursion to
stack. In the end, I had to add a lot more lines than before. I'm not 100%
sure if I'm approaching this correctly, but I used a while loop to replace the
recursive calls in recursion.

Resources I looked up include how to break and continue a outer loop from an
inner loop, and how to convert recursion to stack for factorials. They were
both from stackoverflow.
