This lab was pretty fun but also head aching. I had to restart because my first
approach wouldn't work. This is because I was checking for potential blocker
but would stop after checking 1 and not the rest. I scrapped it and started over
and ended up finishing pretty quick. I believe I have an idea of how to approach
these kinds of problems except that they are getting more complex so I have to
actually draw things out. Overall, was a good, difficult lab. I didn't really
use any resources. I just did a lot of trial and error and referred to my
previous hw's code.
