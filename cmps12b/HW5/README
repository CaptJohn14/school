HW5:
This HW was a headache. The instructions for the hw was missing some stuff.
Took an extra 4-5 hours trying to figure out what the problem was. It was
the punctuations "<>" and quotes. Besides the headache, it was a really
easy lab. Just had to make sure I understood how to use hash tables
because without it, it took extremely long. I see how much more efficient
hash tables are now. I did quite a bit of googling for this one to figure
out how to use custom comparator. Thanks to stack overflow, I did just
that.
