Now that I'm more comfortable with java, I found myself making less syntax mistakes.
For this lab, I did a lot of trial an error. I didn't use google too much. I relied
on the information from lecture and slides. I did however, search for little things
like how to call super. I found this lab to be very fun and helpful because everything
is more organized. It is A LOT easier to find where mistakes are at. Creating
multiple classes helps iron out any bugs because I can test those classes before
actually using them. Although I created a DoublyLinkedList class, for this lab, it
was not really needed but I can see how it can be a lot more useful then a regular
linked list.
