I did quite a bit of googling when I didn't understand what did what such as
charAt() and substring(). Most of the information I found was from stackoverflow
and tutorialspoint.

Submitting the following files for Lab 2:
     FileReverse.java
     Makefile
     README

I also included all the examples and such from the assignment,
gettysburg.txt, and gettysburg-reversed.txt.
