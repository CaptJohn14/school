Lab5:
Working with separate source and header was kinda tricky and took awhile to
figure out. I had to look at my old projects in c. I ran across a lot of
segment faults but slowly but surely ironed them out. I mostly did trial an
error with a little googling and stack overflow for some things.

Submitting the following:
     queue.c
     queue.h
     queueClient.c
     Makefile
     README
