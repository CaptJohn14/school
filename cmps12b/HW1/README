This lab took me at least 30+hours. I don't know java so I had to do a lot of
googling. So far, tutorialspoint is my favorite online resource to learn java.
I did use stackoverflow if tutorialspoint did not have the information I was
looking for. After multiple times starting fresh, I feel very accomplished.
This was a fun hw assignment but also a hard one.

Submitting the following files:
     NQueens.java
     Makefile
     README

I'm not sure what else is needed to turn in but I'm just gonna push what I have.
