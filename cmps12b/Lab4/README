Lab4:
I found this lab very confusing. I understand it conceptually but actually
diving in and using it is quite difficult. I followed a lot of examples
on tutorialspoint.com. Besides that, I just used the class notes and
examples.

Submitting the following files:
     charType.c
     Makefile
     README

I wasn't sure if I was supposed to include alphaNum and cArrays so
I included it as well.
