Lab: Tuesday 8pm

This lab had us create our own subroutines in our own source file that we would later call to be tested
within another. Lab two had us do the same except that lab 3 worked with matrices instead. I believe it 
is important to understand how to create and call functions between the source and header files. This 
helps to stay organized. How I began going about this lab was looking at my lab 2 because it is very 
similar except now its working with matrices created using arrays. I created functions first in the
MatrixMath.c file. That took a bit of research because I had forgotten how to do some of matrix math.
Implementing the functions was a bit confusing at first but got easier after each function. After my 
functions finished, I began doing the tests in mml.c creating multiple matrices as test matrices. I 
came across issues that I wasn't sure how to fix. For MatrixTranspose(), MatrixAdjugate(), and
MatrixInverse(), the test would not pass. I ended up printing the result matrix out to see what it would
spit out and it spat out the exact same matrix as the answer. I was honestly very confused and didn't know
how to approach it till a couple days later. I used my MatrixEquals() functions to test equality instead 
and that seemed to work. I don't think I would approach this lab differently if I was to do this again.
I would make it simpler if anything. I did this lab by myself which took maybe 10-12 hours.
