Summary:
	This lab is based around morse decoding. Based on a sequence of dots and dashes, a character will decoded
and printed onto the oled. We go about this lab our own way without a flow of code or diagram to help dictate how
we approach the lab. Therefore, prior lab's knowledge help in doing this lab.
Approach:
	The first thing I did was made sure I understood recursion. Setting up my tree.c was pretty easy after that.
Morce.c didn't take too long either. I followed the state diagram and modified it very slightly adding a line or two
in each state. The difficicult part was working on lab8.c. I created my flow chart and all that was left was putting
it into code and tweaking it.
Problems: 
	I had a probelm with my programing completely reseting. It had something to do with a pointer dereferencing.
I just started over creating a new project and that seemed to fix it. I had some help from Kyle, a TA, to figure
out what was wrong with my code.
