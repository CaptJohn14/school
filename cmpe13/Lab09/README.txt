Summary: 
In this lab, we created a game called battleboats which is based off the popular stategy
board game battleship. This lab had us working with a partner splitting the amount of work
on the libraries between partners.

Approach:
I did field.c and some of ArtificialAgent.c while my partner worked on protocol.c and 
some of ArtificialAgent.c. I then checked his functions while he checked mines.
This lab was quite difficult to understand but was fun to tackle. Although there was
a lot of conflicts, we resolved them. A lot of information between functions confusing
but was easily explained between one another.
