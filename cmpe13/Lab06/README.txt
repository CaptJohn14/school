Lab 9 Partner: Joe Loughboro

The purpose of this lab, is gain a better understanding of how to communicate between software
and hardware. Interrupts were a big part of this lab. Also, this lab helped us learn how useful 
macros are. Part 1 had us redo the bouncing LED lights just like in cmpe 12 except this time, it 
is in C. Part 2 had us work with the potentiometer.
	Approaching this lab is like approaching a lion that has not had a meal for 2 weeks. I was 
basically lost. I wanted to tackle the lab how I would do it without Leds.h or background code because
that's what I was used to from cmpe12. So I broke it down and understood all the header files before
diving into this beast. For part1, I focused on getting just getting lights to turn on. Once that
was done, the rest was just following the psedo code. Part 2 was the easiest and basically google
was the saving grace. Getting down to part 3, this one took me probably three times as long as part
1 and 2 combined. This one was very confusing as buttons.c was super annoying to test and make work.
I went to lab and had help understanding it and from there, it wasn't so bad. For the actual part 3, 
I had to do some binary math on paper for the toggleing. Then it was just implenting the pseudo code
with my paper coded toggle. 
	This lab should be split into two labs or be a two week lab. I feel I have spent over 30 hours.
For the most part, the manual did cover everything except for a few things. I feel like buttons.c 
had no information and  we were thrown into a frenzy. I suggest more information for buttons.c
The points for part 3 seem very little.
