	This lab had us working a lot with structs which is used to create a list. In this lab,
we used doubly linked lists. Knowing how to access the information within the structs
is important for this lab. This lab revolved around lists and had us organizing the data
within the list comparing strings.
	I approached this lab by reading the entire lab manual which I usually don't do.
The reason I did this was because I was very confused on how to start. Reading the lab made
me realize that it is a good resource for information. Its like a learning tool to help you
create your code. After reading the manual, I first started with creating a source file
to define the functions stated by LinkedList.h. I then proceded to testing them starting with
LinkedListPrint() so I can see what was going in in the other functions. After that was
actually creating a list and having it being organized and printed.
	The first most annoying problem I encountered was the heap size. My program would not
compile whatsoever if I was to call malloc() or calloc(). This was resolved by increasing my
heap size. Besides the heap size problem, I had a lot of problems with memory leaks. At least,
I'm assuming it was memory leaks because I had infinite loops everywhere. This was resolved by
commenting out sections of my code to find out what was wrong. I also had a print issue
where it would only print link->data. This was because i had quotations around it when there
shouldn't be any. Easy fix for a frustrating problem.
	This lab took me easily over 10 hours. A lot of it was just debugging. A good chunk was
also trying to figure out why my code wouldn't compile because of the heap size issue. After
defining functions, it wasn't so bad and I finished swiftly after that.
