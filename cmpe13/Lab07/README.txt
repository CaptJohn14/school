Purpose and importantce of lab:
	The purpose of this lab is to work with state machines using the switch case statement. I notice that
this statement is very similar to the if else statements but can see how using one or the other to be a very
good for organization. This lab also makes good use of enums. Enums can be used instead of #define. This is 
also good for organzation. It was important to get a good feel of switch case statement as well as using enums.
Lab approach:
	I personally went into to this lab thinking it wouldn't take that long. I was definately wrong. As soon 
as I think my code works, it just turns around and breaks on me. I'm not sure why this happened so many times
but I pushed forward. I started with creating my toaster oven and creating a struct for it for the 5 different
state machines. Enums for the state of my toaster oven followed after. I created test printing for every single
case and other places in my code to make it easier to debug. This helped immensily at times and other cases, not
so much. In my opinion, the flow chart for the state machines is very bad. I got confused at which block of text
was attached to which line or state. I figured it out in the end. I then just began implenting each state making
sure I compiled a lot and checked if all was working as intended. All in all, this lab took me probably over 40
hours. Things kept breaking and I actually ended up starting over. After starting over, I kept my code simpler.
The second attempt only took like 3 hours to finish up the lab.
Difficulties: 
	The most difficult thing I had to do was getting LEDS to work properly. Sometimes it would work, and 
other times, it won't. I didn't really know how I solved it. It was mostly trial and error. ALthough it works
most of the time, sometimes it lags or skips. I really enjoyed this lab. This lab is very cool and is fun to
use the hardware.
