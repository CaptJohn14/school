Lab: Tuesday 8pm

	I found this lab to be pretty difficult because there is a lot of new instructions to learn. 
Implementing and using stack was a bit hard to use and is conceptually hard to understand along
with parsing a string into tokens. I believe this lab's main goal is to learn about stacks. 
Doing this lab, I feel I have obtained a higher understanding of stacks. Besides stacks, struct 
instruction was very important and this lab helps us use and understand it.
	The first step I took was to figure out what the lab was asking of me. I've never heard
of RPN notation let alone RPN calculator. Therefore, I looked up examples and found a RPN calculator
to get a general idea of what I was aiming for in this lab. From there, I just followed the code flow
from the lab manual. There was a lot of frustrating problems that I came across. My array was bleeding
over to the next user input. My output only doubled my first operand and completely ignored the second.
My bleeding problem was easily solved by clearing the array. Fixing the doubling problem took some time.
I found out that setting atof(token) to an actualy variable and using that wasn't working. I don't know 
excatly why but using atof(token) instead of the variable in the if argument worked out for me.
	I believe the hardest part was understanding the new material needed to know for this lab. I
think it would be more helpful if we had a better grasp conceptually and more examples.
