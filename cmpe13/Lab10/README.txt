	This lab had us working with multiple .txt files that our code will read and work with.
The purpose of this lab was to correctly implement the correct room depending on what is in the
player's inventory. 

	Overall, this lab was quite fun to even think about let alone actually trying to code it.
I don't think this lab was very hard but I'm having trouble compiling through terminal and running
so I ended up not using the terminal to code. I ended up using MPLAB X creating a project and coding
my thoughts down without anyway to test. If it compiled, I'm hoping thats enough to get a good
enough amount of points.

	Creating Player.c and implementing the functions for it was the first thing I did besides
reading the manual. I thought it was the easiest to understand.The only problem I have with 
it is clearing inventory. I'm not sure how to do it. After, I worked on Game.c. Now this is
what I believe is the core of this lab. I created a new function that would update the current room
so I could call it instead of copying and pasting 4 times. I did a lot of pseudo code before writing
any code. Next was rpg.c. I made sure not to use Player.h in my rpg.c.
